# Infinity Engine
Infinity Engine is a Python-based game engine for building 2D games. at the moment its a fucntional 2D engine more features are currently in works.

Key Features
- Real-Time Game Creation: Create and modify 2D games interactively, with changes reflected instantly.



- Integrated Code Editor: A built-in Python editor for writing and managing game code within the same window.



- Immediate Code Execution: Run your code directly from the editor and view updates in real-time.



- Asset Importing: Easily import images to use as sprites, backgrounds, or other game assets.



- Customizable Background: Change the background color of the IDE window to suit your preferences.


- Code Compilation: Convert your Python scripts into standalone Windows executable.


- Extendable Architecture: Integrate your own Python scripts and external libraries for enhanced functionality.

Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed, along with the following libraries:

pygame: For 2D game development and graphical rendering.
tkinter: For building the code editor and user interface.
PyInstaller: For compiling Python code into a Windows executable.
Installing Dependencies

Installation Instructions
Download or Clone the Repository: Get the project files onto your system.
Install Dependencies: Ensure that Python and all required libraries are installed.
Run the Engine InfinityEngine.exe





Compilation Issues: If the compilation fails, ensure that PyInstaller is installed and that there are no errors in your code.
Code Execution: Debug any Python syntax errors by using the "Run Code" button and checking the console output.
Future Improvements
Syntax Highlighting: Implement a more advanced text editor with syntax highlighting and code auto-completion.
Advanced Asset Management: Support more asset formats like audio files and 3D models.
Custom Game Templates: Add templates for common game types (e.g., platformers, puzzles).
Performance Enhancements: Optimize rendering and code execution for smoother performance.
